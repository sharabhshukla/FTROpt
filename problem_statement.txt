Problem set:
Please find attached a zip file PS2.If you extract it, you will find 6 files. The objective of this
exercise is to develop a portfolio for FTR optimization. Please read more about FTR before approaching
this task. There are 346 nodes in this sample set (Nodes are basically the column names in Z_Cost File. I
have masked them for the sake of confidentiality). You could get any combination of these nodes as
Source and Sinks. A FTR Path is Source to Sink, basically Node A to Node B.
How to read Z_Cost, Z_Rev, Z_MPnsym files:
All the paths are represented in a Matrix form here. Hence the diagonals are zeros. To access a
datapoint Ex: N11 (Source) to N6 (Sink), first you look for the position of the source .. (Column K which is
11). Then the sink (Column F which is 6), So the value you are looking for is in cell F12
What is Decomposition of a portfolio ?
The final portfolio should have Source, Sink and MW values. The sum of MW of a path times the
(Shift factor of Source â€“ Shift factor of Sink) is called the Decomposition (or the exposure of the portfolio
to this Binding constraint)
Limit your total selection to 1500 paths.
Limit per path MW to 50 MW
Z_BCLimits: This one contains different Binding constraints named A1 to An. They all have different min
and Max values.
Z_SF: These are the Shift factors of the above Binding constraints for the 346 nodes.
Lets assume the Z_Cost is the cost of these paths and Z_Rev are the revenue of these paths.
Ultimately, we want the portfolio to obey the min and max for each of these constraints (Portfolio
decomposition). You could maximize rev, minimize cost or get creative with the objective function.
Now, if you want to get even more creative, Use the Z_MPUnSym file to add it to your objective or
constraint list. A higher value here means a preferred path in the portfolio. Use the Z_Hold_Agg file, if
you want to limit the total MW you source or Sink in the portfolio. (Additional efforts if you want to
impress / go deep).
